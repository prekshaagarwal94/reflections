1. When you initialize a git repository the repository shows the files that are
 in the current directory as untracked files. A git status shows the last commit 
and which files have changed since then.

2. The staging area pushes file onto an intermediary "stage" before they can
be committed. The working directory is where we push files onto the 
staging area from. The repository is a collection of files which shows the 
status of each file at the time of each commit.
