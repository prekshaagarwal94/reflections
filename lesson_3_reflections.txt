When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I want to share things with other groups of people or share it on the forum directly, I would want to use a remote
repository instead of keeping all my work local.

2. You might want to pull changes manually rather than have Git automatically up-to-date with your remote to allow for only significant changes to be pulled
on to your local. It makes sense to have the changes updated on the remote 
without pulling them to the local if no additional actions need to be taken on
the files and we only want to share them on the forums.

3. Forks are used within github to make a copy of a repository within github. Clones can be used to copy repositories from the local to another part o fthe local. Branches are linear and are used to define various points of commit within the local.
